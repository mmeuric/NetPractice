# 🌐 NetPractice

*Understanding the fundamentals of networking through interactive exercises.*

## 📌 Overview

**NetPractice** is a networking project from the 42 curriculum.
Its goal is to teach the fundamentals of **IP addressing**, **routing**, **subnetting**, and basic network troubleshooting through 10 practical levels.

Each level presents a broken virtual network that must be fixed by adjusting IPs, masks, routes, gateways, and interfaces until the entire topology becomes fully functional.

This project helped me solidify core networking concepts like:

* Subnetting & CIDR
* Host and network ranges
* Router configuration logic
* Gateway selection & packet flow
* Local vs. remote addressing rules

## 🧠 What You Do in This Project

For each of the 10 levels, you must:

* Read the objective (ex: “PC1 must reach Server2”).
* Analyze the topology and identify broken links.
* Adjust the unshaded fields:

  * IP addresses
  * Netmasks
  * Gateways
  * Router interfaces
* Validate the configuration using **Check again**.
* Export your solution with **Get my config** (one file per level).

All 10 exported configuration files are included in this repository.
